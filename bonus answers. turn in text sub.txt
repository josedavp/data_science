a. The exponential growth is found in all Figures. However the one that I prefer is Figure 3 since its shown in an incremental straight line. However, each Figure shows evidence of exponential growth as shown in the incremental straight line in each chart.
b. Each figure shows asmptotic order. However Figure 2 seems obvious of an asymptotic order. Because they are in the same shape in each Figure.
c. Figure 2 seems best evidence of not O(n) since its not constant and is not in a straight line.
